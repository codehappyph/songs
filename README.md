The following manages this branch:
* Reginald Geoffrey Bayeta IV (Ding)
* Jacob Darvin (Jacob)
* Xenia Francine Umbal (Xenia)

For the merge conflict activity, this is the assigned deliverables for each member:
1. gladiator.txt   (jacob) -> push -> ding -> push (ding PRs, jacob resolve)
2. legendary.txt  (xenia) -> push -> jacob -> push (jacob PRs, Xenia resolve)
3. rememberthename.txt  (ding)  -> push -> xenia -> push (xenia PRs, ding resolve)

N.B. jacob, ding, xenia in this context is a branch under codehappyph/songs repo
Say for gladiator.txt, jacob first pushes his edits, then ding tries to push his, but
encounters a merge conflict. Ding then creates a PR, where Jacob is assigned to resolve.

This demonstrates the usual process of creating and resolving 
a PR wherein it involves collaboration between contributors.
